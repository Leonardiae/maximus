Masternode setup
==========

This tutorial describes how to install a Maximus masternode on an Ubuntu Linux machine. 
It is preferable to use a VPS for stability and security reasons. 
This is a basic guide. If you have questions please reach out and visit our Discord for more information.

Requirements
---------------------
- An Ubuntu VPS
- Have the required amount of MAXI collateral (350) in your wallet + a bit extra to pay for network fees.

Instructions
---------------------

Log in to your VPS and run those commands
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
mkdir -p maximus
cd maximus
wget https://github.com/Maximus-Chain/maximus/releases/download/v1.0.0/maximus-1.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
tar -xvf maximus-1.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
mkdir ~/.maximuscore && touch ~/.maximuscore/maximus.conf
echo "daemon=1" >> ~/.maximuscore/maximus.conf
~/maximus/./maximusd
```

You should see Maximusd starting, we will return to it later.

Now open your Maximus-QT wallet and go to the Receive tab.
Generate three different addresses and label them as follows:

- Masternode Collateral
- Masternode Owner
- Masternode Payout

Send 350 MAXI to the address generated as the Masternode Collateral address. Make sure that the 'Subtract fee from amount' checkbox is not active.
Wait for at least one confirmation.

Go to Window > Console and type:
```
masternode outputs
```
You'll see a response like this:
```
[
  "52f5bc501a2c36b99628335a1c166994ff520e27e78e7d98c8e286a7a3f4c0a4-1"
]
```
Now type:
```
bls generate
```
You'll get a response like this:
```
{
  "secret": "651f742b9c542345c20e8a236093ced15ec4e1d800e6def6090d36aba080ef2e",
  "public": "84d79a0b1381a861513f9d64139f016dd1dd88240aa8e132743128858bc5bc34728f6827b1f0fc3a706083e3f9744ac6",
  "scheme": "basic"
}
```

We will now use those values to register the masternode via the protx register command. This command has the following syntax:

```
protx register collateralHash collateralIndex ipAndPort ownerAddress operatorPubKey votingAddress operatorReward payoutAddress feeSourceAddress
```

For example:
```
protx register 52f5bc501a2c36b99628335a1c166994ff520e27e78e7d98c8e286a7a3f4c0a4 1 1.2.3.4:9939 mUJS91VAiTgZWcT2ufVYTRX3XQuhb8sVgD 84d79a0b1381a861513f9d64139f016dd1dd88240aa8e132743128858bc5bc34728f6827b1f0fc3a706083e3f9744ac6 "" 0 mViwHk64yrssSyjUWiDRnBbpu1bmWeexEW mYUdafagCxHL3woAQUfnasJVsYFMpqemaB
```

Change this command to register the masternode:
- ```collateralHash```: Transaction id from the RPC command “masternode outputs”. This is only the part from before the '-'.
- ```collateralIndex```: The output index of the RPC command “masternode outputs”. This is only the part from after the '-'.
- ```ipAndPort```: Masternode IP address and port, in the format x.x.x.x:yyyy.
- ```ownerAddress```: The address you generated earlier with label Masternode Owner.
- ```operatorPubKey```: “public” value from the RPC command “bls generate” you ran earlier.
- ```payoutAddress```: The address you generated earlier with label Masternode Payout.
- ```feeSourceAddress```: Go to Window > Console and type 'listaddressbalances' to show all addresses with a balance and pick one (not the one holding the masternode collateral).

Now go to Window > Console and enter the command. It should return with a hash. 
N.B. If you get an error, please check carefully if you replaced the values correctly.

Wait for at least one confirmation, return to the VPS and run:
```
~/maximus/./maximus-cli stop
sudo nano ~/.maximuscore/maximus.conf
```

Paste the following:
```
rpcuser=some_username
rpcpassword=some_password
rpcbind=127.0.0.1
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
listen=1
server=1
masternodeblsprivkey=x
externalip=1.2.3.4
```

- ```rpcuser```: Change the username
- ```rpcpassword```: Change the password
- ```1.2.3.4```: External IPv4 address of your VPS.
- ```masternodeblsprivkey```: x = “secret” value from the RPC command “bls generate” you ran earlier.

Save the file with the keyboard shortcut CTRL + x.

Type the following command to start your masternode:
```
~/maximus/./maximusd
```

You can run this command to check the status of your masternode
```
~/maximus/./maximus-cli masternode status
```

You should see
```
  "state": "READY",
  "status": "Ready"
```

Now you can return to your QT wallet to monitor the status of your masternode and payments. 
Make sure that you have enabled the Masternode tab in your wallet. You can do this by going to:
Settings > Options, go to the Wallet tab and enable Show Masternodes Tab. 

If you see
```
  "state": "WAITING_FOR_PROTX",
  "status": "Waiting for ProTx to appear on-chain"
```
It probably means your node is still syncing the blockchain and you have to wait until that's finished.

You can run this command and compare the result with the explorer to follow it's progress.
```
~/maximus/./maximus-cli getblockcount
```
